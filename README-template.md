### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h2>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h2>
```
```css
.description {
  padding: 0 1em;
  margin-bottom: 1em;
}
```
### Continued development

I want to continue practicing to get my hands adapted.

### Useful resources

- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/css) - This helped me with css knowledge. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Flexbox](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/css/flexbox) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understood flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
